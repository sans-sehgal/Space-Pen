# Space-Pen

Th application has been created using openCV. This can detect a pen and can draw on the web cam by mapping hand movements. It can also detect the colour of the pen and draw in that particular colour. This is just a sample project of mine , done while i was trying to learn openCV. Vrious things could be imporved such as, hand mapping could be better and there could be different modes where the user can decide when he wants to draw on the web cam, and when he does not. Currently, as soon as a pen appears in front of a webcam, it will start drawing.
